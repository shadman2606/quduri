      <h3>First day of class</h3>
      <p>
        In the Name of Allah, the Inspirer of Truth.
        <br><br>
        Welcome to Year 4 of the ʿĀlim program, and specifically Mukhtaṣar al-Qudūrī class!
        <br><br>
        You will be doing two sections of Qudūrī with two different teachers in shā Allah.
        I will be teaching the first section, which starts from Kitāb al-Buyūʿ.
        The first day of class will be Tuesday, September 3.
        <br><br>
        For the first day, please prepare 5 pages from the beginning of Kitāb al-Buyūʿ.
        If you do not have the book yet, you can prepare using this <a href="https://archive.org/details/mukhtasar-ul-qudori-al-bushra-color/page/n255/mode/2up">online pdf</a>.
        Note, this online version is a bit old and might not have the same size pages as the physical book you will receive.
        It's not a big deal for the first day. From the second class onward, we will count pages based on the physical book.
